#   Java Practice Questions

Java is a high-level Object Oriented programming(OOP) language . It is a compiled language. It is platform independent.  

It needs a JDK(Java Development Kit) which has the JRE(Java Runtime Environment) and JVM(Java Virtual Machine).
1. The **JDK** provides the necessary libraries along with compiler, debugger,etc. The JVM and JRE are included in JDK. 
2. The **JRE** has the environment necessary to run the files. It has the JVM.
3. The **JVM** executes the Java bytecode which makes Java platform independent.
