#   Java Practice Questions

Java is a high-level Object Oriented programming(OOP) language . 
 It is a compiled language. It is platform independent.    

It needs a **JDK(Java Development Kit)** which has the **JRE(Java Runtime Environment)** and **JVM(Java Virtual Machine)**.
1. The **JDK** provides the necessary libraries along with compiler, debugger,etc. The JVM and JRE are included in JDK. 
2. The **JRE** has the environment necessary to run the files. It has the JVM.
3. The **JVM** executes the Java bytecode which makes Java platform independent.

**OOP Concepts:**  
**1. Abstraction:**  
This means to show only the content which is necessary. It hides the implementation details and shows only the essential functionalities or features to the user.  
Types: Data Abstraction , Process Abstraction.  
Eg: When a user uses the ATM to withdraw money. The whole process behind in the machine is not known , only the final outcome i.e. the money is received.  


**2. Encapsulation:**  
Encapsulation binds data and methods(functions) together as a single unit called Class. Like enclosed in a capsule.  
Eg: 


**3. Inheritance:**  
The child class can inherit behaviours/properties from the parent class.  
Types of Inheritance(4):
                        Multi-level Inheritance (grandparents,parents,child) ,  
                        Single level Inheritance(parent- child),   
                        Multiple Inheritance(2 parents- 1 child) ,   
                        Hierarchical Inheritance (1 parent - multiple children),   
                        Hybrid level Combination of 2 or more inheritance types.        
Eg: Vehicles -> Car -> BMW and  Vehicles -> Bike -> Hayabusa  


**4. Polymorphism:**  
It means the code/object can take up multiple forms. It can be used in various use cases and is adaptable.  
Eg: A person can take multiple role. A daughter, a student, a friend or an employee. Being one shouldnt affect the other.
